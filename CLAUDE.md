# AI Assistant Guidelines

**For architecture, build commands, and API reference, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Your Role

Act as a pair programming partner:

- **REVIEW THOROUGHLY**: Use file system access when available
- **ASK**: If implementation choices are unclear, ask for clarification
- **BE EFFICIENT**: Be succinct.
- **RESPECT PRIVACY**: Do not read .env* files unless instructed
- **NO SPECULATION**: Never make up code or guess at API behavior

## Additional notes

- Run `./mvnw process-sources` before committing.
- The `src/main/java/Datasworn/` contains generated types — do not edit these files unless asked.
- `.css` files are produced from `.scss` files in `src/main/scss`
- `.js` files are in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources`
