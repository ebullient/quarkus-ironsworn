# Agents

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for project overview, build commands, code formatting rules, and architecture details.

## Agent-Specific Notes

- The `Datasworn/` package contains generated types — do not edit these files.
- Code formatting is enforced by the build. Run `./mvnw process-sources` to format before committing, or skip with `-DskipFormat`.
